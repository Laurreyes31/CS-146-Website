		<div><h1 class = "name">Dominick</h1>Dominick Battinelli is a student at Stevens Institue of Technology majoring in cyber security.

		<div><h1 class = "name">Laurent</h1>Laurent Reyes is a student currently studying at Stevens Institute of Technology in cybersecurity. With finals coming near, he realized it is important for everyone to maintain a healthy sleep schedule in order for them to remain at the top of their game academically and handle the intense workload at this point of time. So him along with the others in this group have put together a website which seeks to help not only college students studying for finals, but also people who have sleep problems in general.</div>
		<div><h1 class = "name">Aiden</h1>Aiden Boyce is a sleep deprived college student in his first year at Stevens Institute of Technology studying cybersecurity. He joined this project in hopes of improving his own sleep and helping others. To make up for being unqualified in every way, he researched different habits, postures, and other routines that can affect your sleep. So anyone could've just Google'd it on their own, but it's okay, he did the research so you don't have to! Aiden does not claim to be an expert in the topic in any shape or form.</div>
		<div><h1 class = "name">Tony</h1>Tony Huang is a junior year computer science student. As a junior, he has multiple years experience with not sleeping properly and suffering the consequences. He has pulled multiple all nighters before he realized that the gain in work time is offset by the lost of productivity operating on low hours of sleep. He created the website to not only ensure students are healthy but also to help students operate more efficiently. </div>
